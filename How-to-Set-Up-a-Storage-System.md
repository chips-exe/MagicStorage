This page goes over each component that can be used in a storage system and their purposes. For brevity, recipes are listed with only 1 type of ore. Their variants will work in their place -- "Lead Bar" instead of "Iron Bar", etc.

# Prelude
Key elements of a storage system are:
* a [Storage Heart](#storage-heart),
* a [Storage Crafting Interface](#storage-crafting-interface), and
* at least 1 [Storage Unit](#storage-units).

All of these recipes require a **Storage Component**, the base for all storage system components in Magic Storage. The Storage Component can be crafted with **Wood (10)**, and **Iron Bar (2)**.

This mod adds **Shadow Diamonds**, given to the player in various quantities upon defeating a boss for the first time. These can be used in place of Diamonds in Magic Storage's crafting recipes. Similarly to above, recipes will be listed with only one type of diamond.
# Storage Heart
The _Storage Heart_, aptly named, is the "heart" of the storage system. It is how you access your stored items, and without one a system will not function.

It can be crafted with a **Storage Component**, **Diamond (2)**, and **Emerald (3)** at a **Work Bench**.

# Storage Units
_Storage Units_ are where the items are stored. You will need to craft at least one to store anything in your system.

It can be crafted with a **Storage Component**, **Any Chest**, and **Silver Bar (10)** at a **Work Bench**. 

As you progress through the game, you will discover better resources, and will need to store more items. To reflect this, you can craft upgraded versions of the Storage Units which let you store more items.
