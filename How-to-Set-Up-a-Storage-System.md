This page goes over each component that can be used in a storage system and their purposes. For brevity, recipes are listed with only 1 type of ore. Where "Any" is used, their variants will work in their place -- "Lead Bar" instead of "Iron Bar", etc.

# Prelude
Key elements of a storage system are:
* a [Storage Heart](#storage-heart),
* a [Storage Crafting Interface](#storage-crafting-interface), and
* at least 1 [Storage Unit](#storage-units).

All of these recipes require a **Storage Component**, the base for all storage system components in Magic Storage. The Storage Component can be crafted with **Wood (10)**, and **Iron Bar (2)**.

This mod adds **Shadow Diamonds**, given to the player in various quantities upon defeating a boss for the first time. These can be used in place of Diamonds in Magic Storage's crafting recipes.
# Storage Heart
The _Storage Heart_, aptly named, is the "heart" of the storage system. It is how you access your stored items, and without one a system will not function.

It can be crafted with a **Storage Component** + **Any Diamond (2)** + **Emerald (3)** @ **Work Bench**.

# Storage Units
_Storage Units_ are where the items are stored. You will need to craft at least one to store anything in your system.

It can be crafted with a **Storage Component** + **Any Chest** + **Any Silver Bar (10)** @ **Work Bench**. 

As you progress through the game, you will discover better resources, and will need to store more items. To reflect this, you can craft upgraded versions of the Storage Units with more advanced resources which let you store more items in each Unit.

Storage type|Storage space|Recipe
-----|-----|-----|
Storage Unit|40|**Storage Component** + **Any Chest** + **Any Silver Bar (10)** at a **Work Bench**|
Demonite/Crimtane Storage Unit|80|**Storage Unit** + **Demonite/Crimtane Storage Upgrade**|
Hellstone Storage Unit|120|**Demonite/Crimtane Storage Unit** + **Hellstone Storage Upgrade**|
Hallowed Storage Unit|160|**Hellstone Storage Unit** + **Hallowed Storage Upgrade**|
Blue Chlorophyte Storage Unit|240|**Hallowed Storage Unit** + **Blue Chlorophyte Storage Upgrade**|
Luminite Storage Unit|320|**Blue Chlorophyte Storage Unit** + **Luminite Storage Upgrade**|
Terra Storage Unit|640|**Luminite Storage Unit** + **Terra Storage Upgrade**|

You can also upgrade a Storage Unit to the next tier by right clicking it with the Upgrade item for the next tier.

# Storage Crafting Interface
So you have a storage system, great! But, you will notice that you can't do any crafting through the Storage Heart alone. That's where the _Storage Crafting Interface_ (SCI) comes in.

It can be crafted with a **Storage Component** + **Any Diamond** + **Sapphire (3)** @ **Work Bench** .

The SCI has 15 slots for Crafting Stations, allowing the use of the many stations Terraria (+ other mods!) has to offer. The mod also comes with multiple ways to reduce the number of Crafting Stations you have to put in the SCI:
* [Combined Stations](wiki/Combined-Stations)
* [Biome Globe](wiki/Biome-Globe)
